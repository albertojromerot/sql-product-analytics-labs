# Power BI model notes

This folder contains a simple Power BI theme and guidance to connect to the sample DuckDB outputs.

1. Generate the sample CSVs by running `python src/generate_data.py`.
2. Use DuckDB or import the CSVs directly into Power BI.
3. Apply `model_theme.json` as the report theme for consistent visuals.
